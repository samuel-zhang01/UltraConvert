## 🔨 Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 10+
- macOS (for building the Mac app)

### Environment Setup

1. Copy the example environment file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Fill in the required values in `.env`:

    | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `BUILD_TYPE`             | Set to `"standard"` for full build or `"light"` for minimal build for quick testing, it does not include external binaries |
    | `VITE_IS_OFFICIAL_BUILD` | Set to `false` for personal builds                                                                                         |
